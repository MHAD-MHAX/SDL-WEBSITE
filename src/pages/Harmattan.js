              10 days start to feel like 10 years & i'm forgetting the names of the people i don't see everyday. 
              'less morose & more present' , words definitive of my present. 
              his father called me yesterday & kept circling around the same questions, 
              i felt bad for him, that's his only child. 
              a lot of the boys in the world are sad rn, boys do cry, 
              but i didn't shed a tear for a lot my life because i felt like i wasn't supposed to. 
              i woke up from my life's dream when i got that email, standing in front of a cathedral, the choir harmonising in the background,
              birds tweeting and butterflies passing by me, i lost my obligation & i may have shed a tear,
              i was honest, in that moment, there was no who i thought i was, just who i am. 
              & as a confused lover, i'm still learning the ropes. 
              learning to love, the way i feel things may be too far away for my lover to understand & i can't change that,
              but i hope her purity stays strong. this is the last one for a while so, gotta get it off my chest, i'm just here, right now, & tomorrow i'll be there & everywhere,
              but my tree's roots dug so deep i can never forget what home is.
